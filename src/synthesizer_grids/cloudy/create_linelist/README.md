# Linelist generation

In the synthesizer photoionisation modelling it is necessary to provide cloudy with a list of lines which we're interested in. We provide a default list of lines which was initially generated by this tool. In short, we use the outputs from several `cloudy` runs - including both stars and AGN and range of metallicities in both cases. We then select lines with luminosities above some threshold relative to a reference line. Our default linelist assumes a threshold of $10^{-1.5}$ and $H\beta$ (`H 1 4861.32A`) as the reference line. Custom linelists can be created manually or using this tool.

## Procedure

- extract stellar and AGN spectra for use by cloudy using `extract_spectra.ipynb`.
- run all the `cloudy` models. `cloudy` input files exist for both stellar and AGN sources, including both conventions for line labelling (naming), i.e. standard (air at >200nm, vacuum <200nm) or vacuum wavelengthd.
- run `create_linelist.ipynb` to generate the line list, changing the parameters as necessary.
